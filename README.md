In my data science project on the Comcast Consumer Complaints dataset, I aimed to draw valuable insights from the data to understand the nature and patterns of consumer complaints. The dataset includes various columns such as Ticket ID, Customer Complaint, Date, Time, Received via (Internet, Customer care call), Status (Closed, Solved, Open), State, Zip Code, and Filing on behalf of someone.

The first step in my analysis involved data cleaning and preprocessing, which included handling missing values, converting date and time columns to appropriate formats, and categorizing complaint status. I also standardized the text in the 'Customer Complaint' column to identify and analyze common issues effectively.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was a crucial part of my project. I visualized the distribution of complaints over time to identify trends and peak periods. By examining the 'Received via' column, I determined the preferred channels for lodging complaints, which can help Comcast improve customer service efficiency.

Analyzing the 'Status' column helped me understand the resolution rate of complaints, providing insights into how effectively Comcast addresses customer issues. Geographic analysis, using 'State' and 'Zip Code' data, allowed me to map out regions with higher complaint rates, which could indicate areas needing better service or support.
Overall, my project provided Comcast with actionable insights to enhance their customer service strategy, improve complaint resolution times, and ultimately increase customer satisfaction. The insights gained from this analysis can guide targeted interventions, better resource allocation, and strategic planning for service improvements.
